      "Notepad is a small and fast notetaking app for making notes, memos, or just any plain text content. Features:\n* simple interface that most of the users find easy to use\n* no limits on note's length or number of notes (of course there's a limit to phone's storage)\n* creating and editing text notes\n* importing notes from txt files, saving notes as txt files\n* sharing notes with other apps (e.g. sending a note in Gmail)\n* notes widget allowing to quickly create or edit notes, working like post it notes (stick a memo to home screen)\n* backup function for saving and loading notes from a backup file (zip file)\n* app password lock\n* color themes (including dark theme)\n* note categories\n* automatic note saving\n* undo/redo\n* lines in background, numbered lines\n* technical support\n* search function that can quickly find text in notes\n* unlock app with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint)\n\n** Important **\nPlease remember to make a backup copy of notes before formatting a phone or buying a new phone. Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use Google device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.\n\n* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?\nI follow Google's advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).\n\n* Why is the permission for writing on SD card listed on the permissions list?\nIt's currently not used. It was an optional permission for cases when a backup copy was to be saved on the device. Play Store shows historical permissions, even if it's no longer in use by the app.\nPlease remember that the permission can be revoked at any moment by going into the app's settings. Also, the app will ask for the permission when needed.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .\n\nThank you.\nArek",

Once saved, you can edit, share, set a reminder, or check off or delete the note through your device's menu button. When checking off a text note, the app places a slash through the list's title, and this will be displayed on the main menu.\n\n- Making To-do List or Shopping List -\nIn the checklist mode, you can add as many items as you'd like and arrange their order with drag buttons activated in the edit mode. After the list is finished and saved, you may check or uncheck each line on your list with a quick tap, which will toggle a line slash. If all items have been checked, then the list's title is slashed as well.\n\n\n* Features *\n- Organize notes by color (color notebook)\n- Sticky note memo widget (Put your notes on your home screen)\n- Checklist notes for To do list & Shopping list.

      "New: We partnered with Google to bring incredibly fast, low-latency ink to Squid on the Google Pixelbook and Samsung Chromebook Plus (with Chrome 62). See the difference: https://youtu.be/Oc66T_e7xwU\n\nTake handwritten notes naturally on your Android tablet, phone, or Chromebook supporting Android apps! With Squid you can write just like you would on paper using an active pen, passive stylus, or your finger.\n\nEasily markup PDFs to fill out forms, edit/grade papers, or sign documents. Import images, draw shapes, and add typed text to your notes. Quickly select, copy/paste, and move content between pages and notes. Organize your notes within notebooks and increase your productivity!\n\nTurn your device into a virtual whiteboard or give presentations in a class, meeting, or conference by wirelessly casting to a TV/projector (e.g. using Miracast, Chromecast). Export notes as PDFs or images, then share them with others or store them in the cloud!\n\nSquid is vector based - keeping your notes beautiful at any zoom level and on any device. You can erase entire letters and words quickly with the stroke eraser tool, or just parts of words with the true eraser tool. The selection tool allows you to change the color and thickness of your handwriting and even resize a drawing whenever you want without any loss in quality.\n\nSquid takes special advantage of active pens on capable devices to provide natural, pressure sensitive handwriting. Just write with the pen and erase with your finger!\n\nSquid is designed to be both powerful and simple to use, allowing you to take notes quickly and efficiently.\n\nAwards/Recognition\n• Featured App in Google Play\n• Category Honorable Mention for Productivity in the Samsung Galaxy Note S Pen App Challenge: https://goo.gl/Ji9dCS\n• Popular Choice Award in the Dual Screen App Challenge: https://goo.gl/J7uT0B\n\nKey Features\n• Take notes naturally with a pen and erase with your finger on active pen enabled devices (e.g. Galaxy Note devices with S Pen)\n• Take notes with your finger or passive stylus on non-active pen devices (e.g. Nexus 7)\n• Vector graphics engine\n• Multiple paper types (e.g. blank, ruled, graph) and sizes (e.g. infinite, letter, A4)\n• Undo/redo, select, move, and resize\n• Change the color and weight of selected items\n• Cut, copy, and paste items between notes\n• Two finger scroll and pinch-to-zoom\n• Two finger double tap to quickly jump to a specific zoom level\n• Organize notes within notebooks\n• Sort notes and notebooks\n• Import, crop, and resize images\n• Export notes to PDF, PNG, or JPEG for printing, archiving, or sharing\n• Share notes with friends and colleagues via email, Evernote, etc.\n• Multi-Window support\n• Shortcuts to create a new note or open a notebook\n• Present notes on a secondary display via HDMI, Chromecast, etc. (Android 4.2+)\n\nSquid Premium\n• Create notes and pages with premium backgrounds (math, engineering, music, sports, etc.)\n• Import PDFs and mark them up like any other note\n• Express yourself with additional tools (highlighter, “true” eraser, shapes, text)\n• Backup/restore and bulk export notes as PDFs to cloud storage providers Dropbox and Box\n\nLearn more about Squid Premium: https://goo.gl/mJFjeO\n\nG Suite for Education customers can purchase Squid Premium in bulk using the Squid EDU Bulk License app (https://goo.gl/Kkxjtk).\n\nInformation about active pen devices: https://goo.gl/6BRJy\n\nExplanation of required permissions: https://goo.gl/q5f8Y\n\nIf you encounter any bugs, please email us at help+android@squidnotes.com with a description of the bug!\n\nWe would love to hear any feedback or feature requests you have at http://feedback.squidnotes.com.\n\nInterested in beta testing?
